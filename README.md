Module 3 Challenge

Files included in repository:

PyBank
  - PyBank_Script.py
  - Resources folder with original csv file
  - analysis folder with txt file output

PyPoll
  - PyPoll_Script.py
  - PyPoll_Script_VoterID.py
  - Resources folder with original csv file
  - analysis folder with txt file output

Note: "PyPoll_Script.py" is my submission for the PyPoll half of the challenge.
"PyPoll_Script_VoterID.py" was an extra thing I did after finishing PyPoll_Script.py. 
I wanted to ensure that there were no duplicate voter IDs in the csv file.
I used the set() data type after I learned about it here:

https://www.trainingint.com/how-to-find-duplicates-in-a-python-list.html

The rest of the script is basically the same as "PyPoll_Script.py"
