Note: "PyPoll_Script.py" is my submission for the PyPoll half of the challenge.
"PyPoll_Script_VoterID.py" was an extra thing I did after finishing PyPoll_Script.py. 
I wanted to ensure that there were no duplicate voter IDs in the csv file.
I used the set() data type after I learned about it here:

The rest of the script is basically the same as "PyPoll_Script.py"
